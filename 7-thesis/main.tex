\section*{一、緒論}

社群網站的興起不僅改變了我們的社交生活，更改變了許多國家政治與權力的運作規則。
在國內外皆有愈來愈多政治團體與公民團體透過網路來散佈其理念；
許多具引響力的社會運動也是透過網路來連結潛在支持者或動員大眾；
網路工具的靈活運用甚至還成為候選人能否贏得選舉的關鍵。

這種利用網際網路來號召群眾、表達訴求的作法被稱為數位行動主義（digital activism）。
發生在伊朗的綠色革命（Green Movement）、北非及中東的阿拉伯之春（Arab Spring）、
美國的佔領華爾街運動（Occupy Wall Street），皆被人們普遍認為與網際網路，特別是社群媒體，有密切的關連。
網際網路、社群媒體對社會與政治的影響也成為許多學者關注的新焦點。

同樣的趨勢也發生在台灣。
從洪仲丘事件、太陽花學運到反黑箱課綱運動，網際網路均對這些社會運動的促成扮演了相當關鍵的角色。
這也讓許多社會學家、政治學家、傳播學家與計算機科學家開始對台灣的數位行動主義熱潮產生興趣。
這不但是一個相當新穎的、跨領域的研究主題，這方面的研究對當今台灣社會也是相當重要的。

在台灣，推特（Twitter）較不盛行，人們使用的社群網站以臉書（Facebook）為主。
\,2016\,年總統選舉競選期間，各政黨、候選人、利益團體與意見領袖皆大量使用臉書來宣揚其政治理念。
本研究的目的便是嘗試使用資訊科技，以創新的方法分析這些使用者於臉書上的公開貼文，探討使用者於社群網站上之政治活動的模式。

\subsection*{資訊科技與人文社會跨領域研究的挑戰與契機}

近年來，愈來愈多學者開始嘗試將計算機科學應用於人文社會科學領域，
促成了數位典藏（digital archives）、數位人文（digital humanities）、計算社會科學（computational social science）、
計算社會學（computational sociology）、社會模擬（social simulation）等新興研究領域。
然而，這樣的跨領域研究是否真的有價值一直是備受爭議的。
以下舉出一些此類研究常受到的批評，以及我從事此類研究的立場。

常見對數位人文的批評包含：
\,(1)\,只是用一些空洞的戲法來賣弄他們的研究能力，而沒有真正做出什麼新的分析。
\,(2)\,容易忽略種族、階級、性別、文化、意識型態等面向。
\,(3)\,在這個一切都已經被商品化了的現代社會中，人文學科日漸式微。但數位人文卻頂著科技的光環，而獲得了相當高的經費與聲望。
\,(4)\,研究者的背景不夠多元，其研究可能帶有某些偏見。

常見對社會模擬的批評包含：
\,(1)\,將現實社會過度地簡化為一般化的法則。
\,(2)\,模擬的成果仰賴預先建立好的模型，難以發現新的法則。
\,(3)\,預先建立的模型往往充滿偏見。
\,(4)\,模擬的成果並不能反映出現實社會的情況。

我的回應是，我認為傳統社會科學研究法仍是不可或缺的：
\,(1)\,並非所有問題都適合使用電腦來分析或模擬，有些現象無法被量化或歸納出一般化的法則。
\,(2)\,人文社會科學做的不只是資料分析、統計而已，還包含人文關懷、詮釋、思辨、批判等。
\,(3)\,因此田野工作、民族誌、訪談等研究法仍有其彌足珍貴的價值。

然而資訊科技仍然能對人文學科做出貢獻：
\,(1)\,數位人文提供了一個全新的視野來探究傳統上屬於人文社會科學領域的問題。
\,(2)\,資訊科技能幫助人文學者更有效率地獲得知識。
\,(3)\,資料探勘（data mining）、自然語言處理（natural language processing）等技術使一些過去被認為窒礙難行的研究成為可能。

\section*{二、文獻探討}

\subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}

First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. Please do not use it for A4 paper since the margin requirements for A4 papers may be different from Letter paper size.

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{MATH}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as 3.5-inch disk drive.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: Wb/m2 or weber per square meter, not webers/m2.  Spell out units when they appear in text: . . . a few henries, not . . . a few H.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: 0.25, not .25. Use cm3, not cc. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use (1), not Eq. (1) or equation (1), except at the beginning of a sentence: Equation (1) is . . .

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word data is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter o.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an inset, not an insert. The word alternatively is preferred to the word alternately (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word essentially to mean approximately or effectively.
\item In your paper title, if the words that uses can accurately replace the word using, capitalize the u; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones affect and effect, complement and compliment, discreet and discrete, principal and principle.
\item Do not confuse imply and infer.
\item The prefix non is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the et in the Latin abbreviation et al..
\item The abbreviation i.e. means that is, and the abbreviation e.g. means for example.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if you filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, and Heading 4 are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation Fig. 1, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity Magnetization, or Magnetization, M, not just M. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write Magnetization (A/m) or Magnetization {A[m(1)]}, not just A/m. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write Temperature (K), not Temperature/K.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}  % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
